# Test the policy engine with different risk scenarios
echo ""
echo "1️⃣  LOW RISK OPERATION (Risk Level 1-2):"
echo "   Command: agent start"
echo "   Expected: ✅ ALLOWED - Standard operational command"
echo "   Policy Assessment: Low risk, high compliance"
echo ""

echo "2️⃣  MEDIUM RISK OPERATION (Risk Level 3):"
echo "   Command: agent restart"
echo "   Expected: ✅ ALLOWED - Operational but affects system state"
echo "   Policy Assessment: Medium risk, monitoring required"
echo ""

echo "3️⃣  HIGH RISK OPERATION (Risk Level 4-5):"
echo "   Command: deploy all agents"
echo "   Expected: ✅ ALLOWED - Critical operation with extra validation"
echo "   Policy Assessment: High risk, requires approval trail"
echo ""

echo "4️⃣  BLOCKED OPERATION (Risk Level 5+):"
echo "   Command: rm -rf / (simulated dangerous command)"
echo "   Expected: ❌ DENIED - Dangerous command blocked by policy"
echo "   Policy Assessment: Critical risk, automatic denial"
